The assassins donâ€™t want to split the reward,
so if an assassin A encounters any other assassin B ahead of him
on the same path that A is supposed to follow (no matter how far ahead),
then A uses his magical power to attack B.

After all the magical powers were used,
every assassin who was attacked dies. Suppose
A is a living assassin who attacked somebody.
Now, A will move directly to the position of the assassin
closest to the kingdom that A attacked, with the cost of 1 day.
If there are multiple assassins in the same city simultaneously, they form a pact not to kill each other and start moving together. Once an assassin reaches the kingdom, he cannot be killed anymore, since he can kill the king, take the reward, and leave.
